I call you when I need you, my heart's on firegadfgda
You come to me, come to me wild and wild
When you come to me
Give me everything I need
Give me a lifetime promises and a world of dreams
Speak a language of love like you know what it means
And it can't be wrong
Take my heart and make it strong baby

[Chorus:]
You're simply the best
Better than all the rest
Better than anyone
Anyone I've ever met
I'm stuck on your heart
I hang on every word you say
Tear us apart
Baby, I would rather be dead

this is my read me file.
